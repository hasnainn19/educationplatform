### 📌 What is this?

This is a **pull request** that was automatically created for you because your branches had changes that couldn’t be merged directly.

Pull requests (PRs) are a way to review and apply changes from one branch into another — like combining your edits into the main project.

---

### 🔀 What does this PR do?

It helps you merge the branch **{headBranch}** into **{baseBranch}**, but there were **merge conflicts** that need to be resolved manually.

GitHub couldn’t figure out which version of some files to keep, so now it’s your turn to help.

---

### 🛠️ What do you need to do?

1. On the pull request page, click **“Resolve conflicts”**.
2. You’ll see conflicting sections in the code like this:

    ```diff
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    your version of the code
    =======
    their version of the code
    >>>>>>> {headBranch}
    ```

3. Decide what to keep:
    - Keep yours
    - Keep theirs
    - Or merge both!
4. Once done, click **“Mark as resolved”** and **“Commit merge”**.
5. Finally, click **“Merge pull request”** to complete it.
